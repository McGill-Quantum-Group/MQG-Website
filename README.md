# The McGill Quantum Group (MQG) Website

Welcome! This is where all the website's source code lives. If you would like to run it yourself (for whatever reason), feel free to clone this repo and run the following:

```
npm install
npm run
```

Right now, it only fetches from our databases for auth and for loading post/schedule/resource data. If you want to use your own databases, it'll take a bit more work to set up and run your custom Supabase and Firebase (you'll also need to understand edge functions). If you encounter a bug, please let us know in the issues tab, or on the MQG Discord (https://discord.gg/KY4e9BrQNe).  

We hope you enjoy the website!
